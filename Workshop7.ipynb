    "So what is an API? \n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Applicaation Programming Interface. There is a long explanation of API on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface),\n",
    "but you can simply think of API as a menu that is used in the web. You make a request using a specified url format. Each API has different format, so you can check that through API documentation for more information for each API. In most cases, you need to have an API key (or token). API key (token) is a password - the password gives you the right to access particular API. Sometimes API keys are free or you have to pay for it. Therefore, it is important to _not share your API keys_ - you might end up paying for API requests that you did not make.\n",
